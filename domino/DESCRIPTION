Description: A wrapper on top of the 'Domino Command-Line Client'. It lets you
    run 'Domino' commands (e.g., "run", "upload", "download") directly from your
    R environment. Under the hood, it uses R's system function to run the 'Domino'
    executable, which must be installed as a prerequisite. 'Domino' is a service
    that makes it easy to run your code on scalable hardware, with integrated
    version control and collaboration features designed for analytical workflows
    (see <http://www.dominodatalab.com> for more information).
